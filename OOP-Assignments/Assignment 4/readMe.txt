He wants to see all faulty repair bots whose energy cost to repair does not reach a given value ordered ascending by state. The interface must be able to undo/redo any number of mistakes.
All commands must be in the form:
list maximumEnergyCostToRepair
undo
redo
The space in the hangar where you store the Faulty Repair Bots must change depending on the number of Faulty Repair Bots, extending as needed. (define a vector structure with a dynamically allocated array)
Write notes (specification) on your work and (unit) test everything.
Electricity must not leak from the consoles.
