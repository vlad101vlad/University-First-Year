Implement in C++ the given container (ADT) using a given representation and a dynamic array
as a data structure. You are not allowed to use the vector from STL or from any other library.
Obs:
- Since your implementation will use dynamic allocation, it is a good practice to implement a
destructor, copy constructor and assignment operator as well (even if they are not on the
interface).
- You are not allowed to use the functions memcpy and realloc, because it is not safe to use
memcpy and realloc on memory that was allocated with new. Also, if the memory location
contains objects, undefined behavior can occur. The implementation might still work with
these functions, but it is not a good practice to use them

8. ADT SortedBag â€“ having elements of type TComp, sorted using a relation on the elements
and stored in a dynamic array.
